## New Features & Commands
* Developer-only commands were moved into their own module
    * These commands will no longer show up to people outside of Disguard's dev team
    * [Need to add user verification]
* Add ability to reload individual modules without needing to restart the bot
* Add ability to set custom statuses for Disguard

## Changes & Improvements
* Improve the visual display of information
    * Error message when you have invalidly configured log channels
    * ```Birthday``` module commands - removed unnecessary display of timestamps
* The ```broadcast``` dev command no longer has the ability to send messages to server announcement channels, server general channels, or server owner's DMs
* Change Disguard's default status from ```Watching 69 servers``` to ```Guarding 69 servers```
* Improve user experience of ```data``` command (which retrieves your user data)
* Some commands were moved into different modules that better categorize them (such as the ```data``` retrieval command into the privacy module)


## Bug Fixes
* Fix bug that prevented some servers from having all data necessary for operation saved to the local database, causing errors
* Fix bug with starting reddit feeds
* Fix bug with the regex function in the ```create_reddit_feed``` command
* Fix false positives with verifying the accuracy of configured log channels
    * Disguard will no longer sometimes say log channels are invalid when they're set as the default value
    * Also changed the default values in the database to prevent this from happening again

## Developer Notes
* new cogs: dev, privacy
* add venv files to .gitignore
