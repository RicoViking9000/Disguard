# Patch 0.6.19

## S3 Cloud Storage - Attachment Storage Overhaul

This update migrates on-disk attachment storage to cloud storage. Besides giving me greater flexibility, including no upper storage cap,
this allows Disguard to fully handle attachments larger than the default upload limit, along with creating permanent attachment links without relying on Discord's CDN.

Deploy date: 10/17/25

## New Functionality

- Disguard will now include direct attachment URLs to all message attachments in message delete logs, as opposed to previously uploading all attachments that were under 10MB. From there, you can view or download the attachments directly.
- Add ability to handle attachments larger than 10MB. Note that larger attachments will contribute to your server's storage usage and cap faster. A future update will bring the ability to cap the size of attachments Disguard saves.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix several broken log modules, including message edit, member join, member leave, server update
- Fix issues where certain default avatars caused logs to error out
- Fix issues within several models used for message indexing, including stickers, voice messages

## Dev Notes

- Significantly improved performance of the sync users database function by making use of bulk update operations. It's now
linear O(n) rather than O(n^2)
- Move most asynchronous tasks to the utility run_task task manager, administered by each cog's taskman set
